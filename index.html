    <p>Howdy! This is a website that I built using HTML to practice and improve my Web Development skills. This website acts as a resume as well as a place for me to showcase my projects, hobbies and experiences.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M University. 
        I am currently pursuing both a Bachelor of Science (expected graduation May 2023) and Master of Science (expected graduation May 2025). 
        Some of my extracurriculars include being the Testing & Operations Manager for my school's Sounding Rocketry Team as well as a member of the Formula SAE team.
        I am interested in all things engineering from design to manufacturing. My hobbies include 3D Printing, Porgramming (Languages include: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MATLAB), as well as working on cars. 
        Once I graduate I will be joining Firefly Aerospace in Cedar Park, TX as a Test Infrastructure Engineer.
